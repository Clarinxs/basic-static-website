<p><h3>As has been noted, quantum mechanics has been enormously successful in explaining microscopic phenomena in all branches of physics.</h3>
<h3><u>1.Decay of the kaon</u></h3>
The kaon (also called the K0 meson), discovered in 1947, is produced in high-energy collisions between nuclei and other particles. <br>
It has zero electric charge, and its mass is about one-half the mass of the proton.<br>
It is unstable and, once formed, rapidly decays into either 2 or 3 pi-mesons. The average lifetime of the kaon is about 10-10 second.<br>
In spite of the fact that the kaon is uncharged, quantum theory predicts the existence of an antiparticle with the same mass, decay products, and average lifetime; <br>
the antiparticle is denoted by K0. During the early 1950s, several physicists questioned the justification for postulating the existence of two particles with such similar properties. <br>
In 1955, however, Murray Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais made an interesting prediction about the decay of the kaon. Their reasoning provides an excellent illustration of the quantum mechanical axiom that the wave function ? can be a superposition of states; 
<br>in this case, there are two states, the K0 and K0 mesons themselves.<br>
The reason for defining the two states K1 and K2 is that, according to quantum theory, when the K0 decays, it does not do so as an isolated particle; instead, it combines with its antiparticle to form the states K1 and K2.<br>
The state K1 (called the K-short [K0S]) decays into two pi-mesons with a very short lifetime (about 9 × 10-11 second), while K2 (called the K-long [K0L]) decays into three pi-mesons with a longer lifetime (about 5 × 10-8 second).
The physical consequences of these results may be demonstrated in the following experiment. K0 particles are produced in a nuclear reaction at the point A. They move to the right in the figure and start to decay.<br> 
At point A, the wave function is si = K0, which, from equations, can be expressed as the sum of K1 and K2. As the particles move to the right, the K1 state begins to decay rapidly. If the particles reach point B in about 10-8 second, nearly all the K1 component has decayed, although hardly any of the K2 component has done so.<br>
Thus, at point B, the beam has changed from one of pure K0 to one of almost pure K2, which equation (15) shows is an equal mixture of K0 and K0. <br>
In other words, K0 particles appear in the beam simply because K1 and K2 decay at different rates. At point B, the beam enters a block of absorbing material. Both the K0 and K0 are absorbed by the nuclei in the block, but the K0 are absorbed more strongly.<br>
As a result, even though the beam is an equal mixture of K0 and K0 when it enters the absorber, it is almost pure K0 when it exits at point C. The beam thus begins and ends as K0.<br>
Gell-Mann and Pais predicted all this, and experiments subsequently verified it. <br>
The experimental observations are that the decay products are primarily two pi-mesons with a short decay time near A, three pi-mesons with longer decay time near B, and two pi-mesons again near C. (This account exaggerates the changes in the K1 and K2 components between A and B and in the K0 and K0 components between B and C; the argument, however, is unchanged.) <br>
The phenomenon of generating the K0 and regenerating the K1 decay is purely quantum. It rests on the quantum axiom of the superposition of states and has no classical counterpart.
<h3><u>2.Cesium Clock</u></h3>
The cesium clock is the most accurate type of clock yet developed. This device makes use of transitions between the spin states of the cesium nucleus and produces a frequency which is so regular that it has been adopted for establishing the time standard.
Like electrons, many atomic nuclei have spin. The spin of these nuclei produces a set of small effects in the spectra, known as hyperfine structure. (The effects are small because, though the angular momentum of a spinning nucleus is of the same magnitude as that of an electron, its magnetic moment, which governs the energies of the atomic levels, is relatively small.) <br>
The nucleus of the cesium atom has spin quantum number 7/2.<br>
The total angular momentum of the lowest energy states of the cesium atom is obtained by combining the spin angular momentum of the nucleus with that of the single valence electron in the atom. (Only the valence electron contributes to the angular momentum because the angular momenta of all the other electrons total zero. Another simplifying feature is that the ground states have zero orbital momenta, so only spin angular momenta need to be considered.) When nuclear spin is taken into account, the total angular momentum of the atom is characterized by a quantum number, conventionally denoted by F, which for cesium is 4 or 3. These values come from the spin value 7/2
or the nucleus and 1/2 for the electron. If the nucleus and the electron are visualized as tiny spinning tops, the value F = 4(7/2+1/2) corresponds to the tops spinning in the same sense, and F = 3(7/2-1/2) corresponds to spins in opposite senses. <br>
The energy difference ?E of the states with the two F values is a precise quantity. If electromagnetic radiation of frequency ?0, where hv=change in energy;<br>

Is applied to a system of cesium atoms, transitions will occur between the two states. An apparatus that can detect the occurrence of transitions thus provides an extremely precise frequency standard. This is the principle of the cesium clock.<br>
he apparatus is shown schematically in . A beam of cesium atoms emerges from an oven at a temperature of about 100 °C. The atoms pass through an inhomogeneous magnet A, which deflects the atoms in state F = 4 downward and those in state F = 3 by an equal amount upward.<br>
The atoms pass through slit S and continue into a second inhomogeneous magnet B. Magnet B is arranged so that it deflects atoms with an unchanged state in the same direction that magnet A deflected them. The atoms follow the paths indicated by the broken lines in the figure and are lost to the beam.<br>
However, if an alternating electromagnetic field of frequency v0 is applied to the beam as it traverses the centre region C, transitions between states will occur. Some atoms in state F = 4 will change to F = 3, and vice versa. <br>
For such atoms, the deflections in magnet B are reversed. The atoms follow the whole lines in the diagram and strike a tungsten wire, which gives electric signals in proportion to the number of cesium atoms striking the wire. <br>
As the frequency v of the alternating field is varied, the signal has a sharp maximum for v = v0. The length of the apparatus from the oven to the tungsten detector is about one metre<br>

Each atomic state is characterized not only by the quantum number F but also by a second quantum number mF. For F = 4, mF can take integral values from 4 to -4.<br>
In the absence of a magnetic field, these states have the same energy. A magnetic field, however, causes a small change in energy proportional to the magnitude of the field and to the mF value.<br>
Similarly, a magnetic field changes the energy for the F = 3 states according to the mF value which, in this case, may vary from 3 to -3. The energy changes are indicated. <br>
In the cesium clock, a weak constant magnetic field is superposed on the alternating electromagnetic field in region C. The theory shows that the alternating field can bring about a transition only between pairs of states with mF values that are the same or that differ by unity.<br>
However, as can be seen from the figure, the only transitions occurring at the frequency ?0 are those between the two states with mF = 0. The apparatus is so sensitive that it can discriminate easily between such transitions and all the others.<br>
If the frequency of the oscillator drifts slightly so that it does not quite equal ?0, the detector output drops. The change in signal strength produces a signal to the oscillator to bring the frequency back to the correct value. <br>
This feedback system keeps the oscillator frequency automatically locked to ?0.<br>
The cesium clock is exceedingly stable. The frequency of the oscillator remains constant to about one part in 10^13. <br>
For this reason, the device is used to redefine the second. This base unit of time in the SI system is defined as equal to 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels F = 4, mF = 0 and F = 3, mF = 0 of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom. <br>
Prior to 1967, the second was defined in terms of the motion of Earth. The latter, however, is not nearly as stable as the cesium clock. Specifically, the fractional variation of Earth’s rotation period is a few hundred times larger than that of the frequency of the cesium clock.
<h3><u>3.A Quantum Voltage Standard</u></h3>
Quantum theory has been used to establish a voltage standard, and this standard has proven to be extraordinarily accurate and consistent from laboratory to laboratory.

If two layers of superconducting material are separated by a thin insulating barrier, a supercurrent (i.e., a current of paired electrons) can pass from one superconductor to the other. This is another example of the tunneling process described earlier.<br>
Several effects based on this phenomenon were predicted in 1962 by the British physicist Brian D. Josephson.<br>
Demonstrated experimentally soon afterwards, they are now referred to as the <b>Josephson effects</b>.
If a DC (direct-current) voltage V is applied across the two superconductors, the energy of an electron pair changes by an amount of 2eV as it crosses the junction. As a result, the supercurrent oscillates with frequency ? given by the Planck relationship (E = h?). Thus 2ev=hv;<br>
This oscillatory behaviour of the supercurrent is known as the AC (alternating-current) Josephson effect. Measurement of V and ? permits a direct verification of the Planck relationship. Although the oscillating supercurrent has been detected directly, it is extremely weak.<br> A more sensitive method of investigating equation  is to study effects resulting from the interaction of microwave radiation with the supercurrent.<br>
Several carefully conducted experiments have verified equation (19) to such a high degree of precision that it has been used to determine the value of 2e/h. This value can in fact be determined more precisely by the AC Josephson effect than by any other method. <br>
The result is so reliable that laboratories now employ the AC Josephson effect to set a voltage standard. The numerical relationship between V and ?.<br>
